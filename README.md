# HackingToolkit9DS

UPDATE AS OF DECEMBER 20st 2025
This is a Port to Linux. Nothing more the Project is still dead!

With this tool, you'll be able to:
- Extract and rebuild any .3DS file
- Extract and rebuild any .CIA file (No DLC nor DSiWare atm)
- Extract any .CXI file
- Extract and rebuild a 3DS banner file (shown on the 3DS home menu)
- Mass extract and mass rebuild any .3DS and .CIA files in the same time
- Extract any ncch partition from a .3DS file (CIA support is planned)
- Extract contents from a decrypted ncch binary file

Before report an issue, be sure:
- Your 3DS|CIA|CXI file is clean and not decrypted by Decrypt9 or GodMode9.
- Your 3DS|CIA|CXI file doesn't have any space or special character in its name (such as é or à).
- Your 3DS|CIA|CXI file is in the same folder as HackingToolkit9DS.
- You're not trying to extract the file in the ProgramFiles folder (where installed core files are).
- To write or don't write the extension of your file when specified.
- To have installed the setup package for your language (SetupXX.exe file).

Extract 3DS should work, but the rest I haven't tested
